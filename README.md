# Alternatives

I'm aware this code is a little crusty. :)
- A fiddle I wrote awhile ago http://jsfiddle.net/42EDX/40/
- An iOS app I made http://WinstonOne.com/Apps/Stronghold%20Locator
- Another fellow's implementation in web technologies http://www.purplefrog.com/~thoth/MinecraftStronghold/stronghold.html (is well factored and reusable)
- Uses seed and has the kitchen sink (I think) http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/626786-v36-amidst-strongholds-village-biome-etc-finder-174/
